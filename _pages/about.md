Welcome! I am an evolutionary biologist with a diverse research background, ranging from studies in ecological succession and invasive species to biogeography and evolution of marine organisms. My [research](https://lawleyjw.github.io/research/) integrates omics tools, morphological analyses, and field- and lab-based investigations to unravel patterns and drivers of diversification, as well as the underlying mechanisms of evolutionary change. My experience also involves teaching in various formal and informal settings, reviewing and editing academic texts, as well as programming and [bioinformatics](https://lawleyjw.github.io/bioinformatics/).
<br/>
<br/>
I am a Research Fellow in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics at the [Centre for Planetary Health and Food Security](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-planetary-health-food-security) at [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au), where I am working in several projects related to crop and pathogen genomics, such as genetic management of Ascochyta blight of chickpea and developing molecular diagnostics tools for oyster QX disease. I earned my PhD from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au), Australia (2019 - 2023), my MSc in Zoology from the University of São Paulo, Brazil (2016 - 2018), and my BSc in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil (2009 - 2015).
