Welcome! I am an ecologist and evolutionary biologist with a diverse research background, ranging from studies in ecological succession and invasive species to biogeography and evolution of marine organisms. My [research](https://lawleyjw.github.io/research/) integrates omics tools, morphological analyses, and field- and lab-based investigations to unravel patterns and drivers of diversification, as well as the underlying mechanisms of evolutionary change. My experience also involves teaching in various formal and informal settings, reviewing and editing academic texts, as well as programming and [bioinformatics](https://lawleyjw.github.io/bioinformatics/).
<br/>
<br/>
I am an Ecologist at [Ecological Service Professionals](https://www.ecosp.com.au/) and an Adjunct Research Fellow at [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au). At Griffith University I worked in several projects related to crop and pathogen genomics, such as genetic management of Ascochyta blight of chickpea and developing molecular diagnostics tools for oyster QX disease. I earned my PhD from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au), Australia (2019 - 2023), my MSc in Zoology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (2016 - 2018), and my BSc in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil (2009 - 2015).
