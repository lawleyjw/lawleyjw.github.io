My research falls into three main areas: **molecular biology**, **systematics**, and **biogeography**. Research projects often involve a combination of these areas to investigate morphological change, speciation and macroevolutionary patterns. For published outcomes from projects and collaborations, see full list of [publications](https://lawleyjw.com/publications/).

## Key projects

### Developing advanced diagnostic tools for QX disease in oyster aquaculture
In collaboration with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) we are developing advanced diagnostic tools for QX disease in oyster aquaculture, including a reliable qPCR-based assay for the parasite <i>Marteilia sydneyi</i> and a field-friendly point-of-care solution. These tools will enhance our understanding of the parasite and improve disease management, contributing towards sustainable oyster aquaculture and industry.

### Using genomics to unravel the increasing aggressiveness of Ascochyta blight disease in chickpea
Ascochyta Blight caused by <i>Ascochyta rabiei</i> is a major biotic threat to chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>) worldwide and it incurs substantial costs to the Australian multimillion-dollar chickpea industry in disease control expenses and in yield losses. We are integrating advanced molecular biology tools to uncover the genetic factors driving aggressiveness, with the aim of developing molecular tools to rapidly determine an isolate’s potential to cause disease and improve breeding efforts for chickpea growers.

### Drivers of colour variation in jellyfish

</p>
Colour can play an important role in an organism’s survival, providing camouflage and photoprotection, and influencing sexual selection and social interactions. The goal of this project was to investigate the endogenous and exogenous drivers of colour variation in the blubber jellyfish <i>Catostylus mosaicus</i>. One of the project's results has been published, while others are in preparation.

### Systematics of the moon jellyfish genus <i>Aurelia</i>

</p>
Since the 19th century, taxonomists have puzzled on how to identify moon jellyfish species. In this project, morphological and molecular data were analysed from a wide range of specimens to delimit and describe the cryptic species in the genus.

### Phylogeography of the box jellyfish <i>Alatina alata</i>

<i>Alatina</i> jellyfish are notorious for their sting along beaches where they occur, but it was unclear whether they were distinct or a single species with worldwide distribution. A phylogeographic analyses was reported in this project, which corroborated morphological and behavioural evidence to indicate the presence of a single, pantropically distributed species.
